  brief: [
    <p>A group project at UCI to learn the fundamentals of creating an ecommerce website.</p>,
    <p>We decided to make a mock store for D&D goods.</p>
  ],
  outcomes: [
    <p>This project came in four phases:</p>,
    <ul>
      <li>Build the basic website</li>,
      <li>Using pure Javascript, implement forms with verification</li>,
      <li>Using PHP, communicate with our database</li>,
      <li>Using Java and the Jersey REST API, replace PHP and add user history</li>,
    </ul>,
    <p>In each phase, we added complexity to the website</p>,
    <p>From simple regex to retooling how information was stored and populated.</p>,
    <p>Since this started around the beginning of mandatory online classes,</p>,
    <p>we were introduced to a standardized environment using Docker</p>,
    <p>The Docker images used Apache TomCat and MariaDB.</p>
